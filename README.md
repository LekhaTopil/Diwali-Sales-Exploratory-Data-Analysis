# **Diwali Sales Exploratory Data Analysis**

In this exploratory data analysis project, I delved deep into understanding the factors influencing sales generation, the distribution of sales across various industries, geographical sales patterns, and the product categories driving the highest sales volumes.

# **Project Details**

I initiated the project by performing essential data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, eliminating duplicate entries, and ensuring correct data types. Subsequently, I delved into data distribution analysis, exploring how variables are distributed across different demographics such as gender. I employed descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to identify outliers and gain insights into consumer behavior.

I focused on understanding our audience's impact on sales and business influence by examining key demographics such as gender, age, and marital status. Leveraging data visualization techniques, I addressed critical business questions related to consumer demographics, geographical sales patterns, and sales across various industries. Through this analysis, I gained insights into consumer behavior and the factors driving sales performance, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic business planning.

While exploring the dataset, I encountered inconsistencies in certain variables, highlighting the need for additional data to uncover consumer behavior patterns and emerging trends.
